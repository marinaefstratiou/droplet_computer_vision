# Droplet Computer Vision

Some utilities related to identifying droplet shapes and weights

These utilities are to be used along with the droplet videos in google drive.

- **droplet_volume.ipynb:** The sofware processing droplet contact angle and volume is crashing. This notebook measures them from the images exported from my camera.
- **scale.ipynb:** My high precision scale is too old to connect to a computer so in order to monitor the droplet evaporation rate I am reading the weight from a video. This notebook automatically reads the numbers. It uses plain old OpenCV.
